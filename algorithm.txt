Pseudocode for Slither Game algorithm

clear workspace 

Initialize variables 
    create simpleGameEngine object 
    create the board
    load sprites 
    load sound effect 

set difficulty level based on user input
    loop until user provides valid input 
draw board with snake and apple at initial position

start game loop 
    start frame loop 
        start game timer

        clear graphics from previous frame

        test snake conditions

            if the snakes will hit itself
                break
            if the snakes will collide
                break
            if the snakes will hit the wall
                break
        
        update snake position based on user input
            'w' = 1up

        test if any of the snake eats the apple
            if snake1 eats the apple
                increase snake1 length
                increase score
                generate new apple

                increase snake2 length
                increase score
                generate new apple

        update snake body positions 
            append new head position to snake body
            keep the length of snake body equal to the length of snake
        
        generate new apple if apple is eaten
            if the apple is generated on snake body
                generate new apple on new random position 
            update last apple position
            reset apple generation counter

        draw snakes and apple to the board 

        pause game timer until the next frame
    end of frame loop
    
    play user death sound effect
    display game over message

    pause before restarting the game

    ask if the user wants to play again
        if yes
            reset game variables
            restart game loop
        if no
            break 
end of game loop

Event listeners: 
on bgm music end
    play bgm music again
on user press key
    if key is valid
        update user input
